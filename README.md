## Xbox Game Comment Scrawler
This is a collaborative project for Natural Language Processing Course Project in USC. 
Here I try to collect comments in Xbox Store for user comments. 
There are two separate scrawler:
(1) Use `Scrapy` framework` and can be executed using `scrapy crawl Fortnight` combined with `selenium`. But somehow this scraler has been banned from microsoft website on my computer
(2) Only use `selenium` in file `chrome_spider` , simply run `python chrom_spider`.
