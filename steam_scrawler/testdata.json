Countless hours of trying to reach the never ending urge to dance on your final opponent as you shotgun him/her from above to attain that llama dinner. The creators of the game keep adding more awesome equipment and out of this world skins that can either be attained or purchased.

Then the shopping cart glitch and The Walking through walls glitch happened. then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ARs and other guns. fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a Victory royale. 25 or 50 vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more money.I hope u found this useful."}, {"review_id": "2d7f517c-5bf8-cf7c-b370-ec0abab6eb27", "star": "3", "header": "Review Title", "helpful": "447 out of 692 people found this helpful.", "comment": "Fortnite ok but the lag is annoying"}, {"review_id": "ab319468-ca72-e210-9df0-be824b2a24d1", "star": "5", "header": "Review Title", "helpful": "170 out of 255 people found this helpful.", "comment": "good but i wis i could play with ps4 players"}, {"review_id": "c95757cf-0f44-46cc-a9a0-190994443e54", "star": "2", "header": "Review Title", "helpful": "109 out of 161 people found this helpful.", "comment": "It used to be amazing but now it crashes."}, {"review_id": "6066cd68-7fbb-c81a-13ad-3e7b5db2c0a4", "star": "1", "header": "Review Title", "helpful": "83 out of 121 people found this helpful.", "comment": "The more you add to the game, the worse it gets.

(Tragic...) Constantly releasing cosmetics and skins instead of addressing lag, crashing, and horrible gun imbalances is rather sad Epic Games. Just another large game company taking advantage of kids w their parents credit card. I recommend Far Cry 5, Battlefield 1, or Star Wars BF 2. Not P2P and rather enjoyable.

You'll run into more sweaty, build god players who play this game almost 24/7 that you won't be able to learn the game because you'll be dying so much (hiding all game doesn't help either). Oh and if you already know how to play, GREAT! You'll have a boring build off of who can build faster than just height advantage the enemy player. You like the skins and emotes? Pay $5-$20 for them EACH. This game is popular because of streamers/youtubers possibly being paid by Epic games to promote it.

But without that being said, let's talk about the things what I like and dislike about Fortnite. The pros: The building mechanic, the art style, the iconic emotes, the item store, (at least it's not p2w) the outfits/character customization system, the gunplay, and killing someone and collecting there loot. The cons: The gameplay is shallow, it's unbalanced, the annoying shotguns, sometimes there's glitches, and it's repetitive. (Overall) Fortnite: Battle Royale could've been great, but it's not. I am glad that its popular, but it's a little disappointing but it isn't bad. (Final Verdict) 6/10 needs some work.

So Epic decided to sap off of PUBG's success with BR, but this time making it free and advertising it to younger people. Thats how fortnite BR became popular.

Every gun was balanced, there was no pressure to force yourself to conform to a certain play style, and you weren't hounded into purchasing the accursed Battle Pass for an edge and exclusive costumes. Now, it is a different story. The only way to succeed in this game is to make sorry attempts to build while those who have an easier time doing so punish you for being a slow learner. Being strictly a combat player is impossible now. Furthermore, being a free to play player makes achieving the highest level implausible, with the Battle Pass giving an XP boost, which, although not mandatory, makes F2P players' progression of leveling seem futile. Lastly comes recent updates. The addition of a new submachine gun has made every weapon inferior. Why does a common SMG have a greater damage per second than any rarity ******* rifle or shotgun? It shouldn't.
