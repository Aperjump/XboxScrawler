Twice the game went entirely black but I could still hear the music. The only thing I could do was shut the computer off because I couldn't get out of the game. I did enjoy some of the mini games but storyline was lost in translation. It seemed that the only purpose of this particular game is to go to one scene, do one thing, look at the map, go to next scene, find one thing, look at the map. Literally all you do is go back in forth. Thank goodness for a map because there is no way I would have figured out the next spot or even remembered where it was at. Sorry Big Fish, not  fan of this one."}, {"review_id": "90d2c478-8966-7784-c23c-9ce265a19beb", "star": "3", "header": "See if it drops to $.99 then consider it", "helpful": null, "comment": "The music wasn't bad and the graphics were ok.
